    <h3>Safety instructions</h3>
    <p>When interacting with cats, it is important to keep in mind that they are not just soft and squishy.
    <br>They can be dangerous too, with their

    So here is a map of safe and unsafe zones to pet a cat!</p>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/petmap.jpg" alt="Image of cat with marked safe and unsafe zones to pet" width="600">
    <!-- I wanted to make an image map here, but I didn't have time to figure out all the pixel cooridinates for the clickable areas. 
    I wanted the clickable areas to link to a picture or gif of a happy or angry cat, depending on where on the image you click-->

    <p>So, will you only go for the safe zones next time you pet a cat?</p>
    <form>
        <input type="radio" id="yes" name="safe_zones_yes/no" value="Yes">
        <label for="yes">Yes</label>
        <br>
        <input type="radio" id="no" name="safe_zones_yes/no" value="No">
        <label for="no">No</label>
    </form>

    <p>Last but not least, here is my all-time favourite cat meme, in a few different variations. Enjoy!</p>
